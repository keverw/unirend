## Overview

Unirend provides a collection of built-in plugins that handle common server functionality. These plugins are available through the `unirend/plugins` namespace and can be easily integrated into your SSR or API servers.

> Note: This page lists the ready-to-use, maintained plugins that ship with Unirend. If you want to build your own plugin or learn how the plugin system works, see the server plugin system guide: [docs/server-plugins.md](./server-plugins.md).
